# Link-Development Demo Website

High fidility implementation of a design mockup by Figma.
I used React and plain CSS.

## Installation

1. Download the repo

2. Inside run

Note: make sure `node.js` is installed
```bash
npm install # install dependencies
npm run server # run the json-server to simulate fake backend
npm run dev # run the development server
```

## Future roadmap

- implementing CI/CD to host it using GitHub pages while using environment variables to switch between production build and development with JSON-server.

- fixing hero section aligment to maintain visual hierarchy
